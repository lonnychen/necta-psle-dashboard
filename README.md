# NECTA PSLE Dashboard
This repository contains the notebooks and data used by the Data Safari team to create the dashboard publicly accessible at https://bit.ly/psle2022mvp.

## Summary

### Inspiration
Every year in Tanzania, the publication of Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results is a national data moment for students, parents, teachers, schools, and the government, traditionally determining placement of standard seven leavers into secondary school. Student results are found on per-school web pages but **open access** to wider analysis such as urban vs. rural or regional comparisons, beyond the now de-prioritized rankings, is still needed. Further **linking results to resources data**, and geographical features provides an untapped opportunity to **make data useable** to inform policy decisions, and improve educational outcomes <a href="#references">[1]</a></b>.

### Dashboard
Our solution is a publicly accessible data dashboard that is intuitive and attractive to the general public, and flexible and powerful enough to enable deep technical analysis. By providing a platform for anyone to discover data-driven insights, we hope to contribute to systematic data-driven improvements in the education sector in Tanzania, and collaborate with and inspire others to do the same globally. Dashboard features include:
- **Interactive maps** to visualize and access data at various levels
- **Analysis tab** for both univariate and bivariatee data exploration
- **Prediction tab** for machine learning predictions

### Users
Specific user groups include:
- **Government education authorities:** policy evaluation and setting
- **School administrators:** resource review and advocacy
- **Education sector funders and NGOs:** target funding gaps
- **Researchers:** expedite their own analysis needs


## Project Documentation

### Data Documents
Two documents are useful to understand the data used:
- **data_dictionary.xlsx**: per-column notes
- **data_provenance.xlsx**: per-dataflow step notes

### Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are used to run project code. Some documentation conventions:

**Learnings:**
- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Python and libraries
- üìö Machine Learning
- üòé Cool concepts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas!


## Data Sources and Methodology

- **National Examinations Council of Tanzania (NECTA):** This council adminsters and publshes PSLE (and other exams) data on their [PSLE Results](https://necta.go.tz/psle_results) portal. Going down the administrative divisions, the individual school pagse are found, for example here for [Jitegemee Primary School](https://onlinesys.necta.go.tz/results/2022/psle/results/shl_ps1104063.htm) in Morogoro Municipality, Morogoro Region. We webscraped all of these pages, resulting in a DataFrame of **17,900 schools** (public and private) with non-missing results data. The "WASTANI WA SHULE" number is the average of all students for that school out of a total of 300, 50 each for the six tested subjects of Kiswahili, English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, and Civics.
    - **Notebook:** <01-webscrape-necta.ipynb>
    - **Results data**:
        - `average_300` school results average out of 300 marks
        - `average_2tile`, `average_5tile` quantiles (Government @nation)
        - `pct_passed` with A-C grades<br><br>
- **President's Office - Regional Administration and Local Government (TAMISEMI):** This central authority for coordinating regional and local development initiatives collects and publishes per-school resources, ages, and gender data annually, such as here for [Basic Education Data 2022](https://www.tamisemi.go.tz/singleministers/basic-education-data-2022). A key task was to merge schools between the NECTA and TAMISEMI datasets first using NECTA (exam centre) ID then a second pass by \[school, council\] names.
    - **Notebook:** <02-merge-tamisemi.ipynb>
    - **Resources datasets**:
        1. Consolidated: geo and adminstrative locations, school ownership, Pupil-to-Teacher Ratio (PTR)
        2. Textbooks: Pupil-to-Book Ratio (PBR) > also Book-to-Pupil Ratio (BPR)
        3. Capitation Grant (CG) > per-student
        4. Enrollment (age and sex) > ages mean<br><br>
- **Feature Extraction:** Geographical and demographical variables were extracted based school coordinates (government-only) as potential factors in performance <a href="#references">[2]</a></b>.
    - **Notebook:** <03-feature-extraction.ipynb>
    - **Extracted data**:
        - Population density: [Meta Data for Good source](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/high-resolution-population-density-maps), [mWater data query](https://portal.mwater.co/#/resource_center/population_queries)
        - Distance to closest other school 
        - Distance to council headquarters<br><br>
- **Data Cleaning Apporach:** We cleaned data as immediately as possible as per requirements of downstream merges and feature extraction.
    - **Notebooks:** <\*.ipnyb>
    - **Tasks:**
        - Remove NECTA schools with no results data
        - Correct duplicated or incorrect NECTA IDs > correct before 1st pass merging
        - Equalize mismatching school names > correct before 2nd pass merging
        - Correct latitude/longitude coordinates > correct before feature extraction


## Next Steps

1. Additional dashboard features and tabs
2. Integrate time-series data from 2013-21
